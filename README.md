# WebR/Shinylive GPX File Viewer

## Description
The WebR/Shinylive GPX File Viewer is a simple, browser-based application that allows users to upload and view GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files on an interactive map. This project serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the capabilities of WebR and Shinylive for creating web-based R applications.

## Features
- Upload and parse GPX files
- Display GPS tracks on an interactive Leaflet map
- Adjust time zones
- Animated playback of GPS tracks
- Display current time and position

## How to Use
1. Visit the application at https://sayersr.github.io/webr-shinylive-gpx/
2. Wait for the initial load (this may take a moment due to WebR initialization)
3. Upload a GPX file using the file input button
4. Interact with the map and use the provided controls to explore your GPS data

## Why It May Take Time to Load
The application is powered by WebR, which allows R to run directly in your web browser. When you first visit the page, your browser needs to download and initialize the R environment, which can take some time depending on your internet connection and device performance. Once loaded, the application should run smoothly.

## Known Limitations
As this is a proof-of-concept, there may be limitations or issues not yet identified. If you encounter any problems, please report them to the developer.

## Future Plans
While there are no specific plans for major feature additions, the developer may tinker with and improve the application over time.
